# Accredit: Authentication and Authorization for Kohana 3.3
Kohana's default auth module doesn't play well with anything but the included ORM module. To solve this, I've adapted [Wouterrr's ACL](https://github.com/Wouterrr/) stuff to work with Brass, and I aim to maintain it very actively, as I'm using it in production on many of my own projects.
